        Number of sum supported.

config EVENT_NAME_ENABLED
    bool "Provide function to convert event ID to name"
    default y
    help
        At debugging, it is convenient to show event name rather than
        event ID. However, the conversion will take code spaces. Unless
        when code size is critical, it is recommended to enable it.

config CFW_PENDING_UTI_COUNT
    int "Maximum CFW waiting count"
    default 64
    help
        For each pending UTI, CFW dispatch shall record the response
        task, and static memory is used to record this.

config CFW_SKIP_NV_SAVE_RESTORE
    bool "Skip CFW NV save and restore"
    default n
    help
        It is for debug only.

        When it is defined, CFW NV save and restore are skipped.

config CFW_CALL_WITH_RPC
    bool "Use RPC to call CFW API"
    default y if SOC_8910
    default n
    help
        When CFW is implemented on other CPU, it is needed to use RPC
        to call CFW APIs. In this case, it is needed to enable this.

config CFW_CALL_STACK_WITH_IPC
    bool "Use IPC to call stack"
    default y if SOC_6760
    default n
    help
        When stack is implemented on other CPU, it is needed to use IPC
        for stack messages.

config CFW_DEBUG_IPFILTER
    bool "CFW simple IP filter (debug only)"
    default y if SOC_6760
    default n
    help
        When enabled, uplink IP packet will be filtered inside CFW.
        Only certain IP packets for debug purpose (such as ICMP, iperf,
        DNS and etc) will be sent to stack.

        This is for debug only. Don't enable it in real products.

config LTE_ONLY_SUPPORT
